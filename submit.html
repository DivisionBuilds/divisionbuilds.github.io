    <h1>Submit a build</h1>
    <p>
    	Instead of using this form you can submit your build via <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/issues" target="_blank">Github Issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DivisionBuilds/divisionbuilds.github.io/pulls" target="_blank">Github Pull Request</a> aswell.
    	If you want to know more <a href="contribution">click here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	We also accepts links to your build info, if you already published the build somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    	If you do not have a Github account, feel free to submit your build via e-mail (<a href="mailto:divisionbuilds@gmail.com">divisionbuilds@gmail.com</a>) or message me on Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Zerthox" target="_blank">u/Zerthox</a>) or Discord (<a href="https://discord.me/divisionbuilds" target="_blank">Zerthox#1999</a>) and I will try to respond as soon as possible.

            The form will be back after it has been updated and made it more user friendly. You can still use the other ways of build submission listed above.
