build: 
    general:
        - "This Lonestar build utilises the Cassidy's exotic talent Boom Stick, to gain fast bursts of damage with the Lonestar Buff"
        - "It's reconmended to test this build on AI, to gain an understanding to how the  build works."
        - "When the Lonestar Buff procs, controlling recoil will be hard without previous experience"
        - "During testing of the build, the best way to guarantee all stacks are not wasted is too spam LMB or Bumper."
        - "Skill haste sits around 40% skill haste, but this does not mean you can face tank without proper strategy"
        - "If attempting to use this build in Last Stand, remember to change a mod to Stamina Skill haste due to the balancing of stats"
        - "Caution, People may remove you from friends list due to extreme annoyance"
