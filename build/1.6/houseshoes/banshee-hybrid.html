build: 
    general: 
        - "This is a very solid build to fight solo against multiple rogues. Here is a video of the build in action with all the gear details and a couple of 1v3s and 1v4s in the DZ (12:48 mins):"
        - "<iframe width='560' height='315 'src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYhPHb90Esg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>"
        - "Many players prefer specialized backpack for this form of builds but I decided to go with Savage gloves instead because I am not running a pulse and want to get my CHC as high as possible to play out the high amount of CHD this build has."
        - "I know, shock turrets are considered cheesy by many players but it's good to have some form of croud control when fighting multiple agents solo."
        - "The shock turret pairs very well with the MP5 because you wanna fight close range with this build. And with 6k electronics, the turret has a mean range and shocking time and with the amount of skill haste I usually have the turret back before it dies."
        - "33.5% CHC might sound too low but you have to add the bonus of Savage gloves and Precision talent. If you still think it is too low switch a weapon mod."
        - "MP7 also works extremely well for this build."
        - "Competent might be even better than Deadly on the MP5. Some people don't like Unforgiving, but I think it's a great talent especially when playing solo because your health will be low a lot of times."
        - "Don't hip fire too much with this build. Try to shock them and burst'em down."
