    general: 
        - "First off, this is possibly one of the most fun builds to blow steam off with. You are a wrecking house once you build up your Striker stacks. My test bed is Lexington Challenging. I can take out all the enemies in the starting road area outside with 17 rounds, 2 to spare. It's ridiculous. I can drop a heavy in 5-7 rounds depending on my stacks."
        - "I think if I can get the proper rolls, I will replace the crit gear for health gear, but that takes time. As far as XP instead of ammo, it’s not a choice, but just the luck of the draw, but as far as I can tell, with other harness that has the ammo on it, it doesn’t make a difference for shotguns for some reason. Maybe someone can explain it to me. I have 218 shells regardless of what version of the chest I’m wearing."
        - "The crown jewel of this build is most certainly the health on kill. With this set up, I get back 31% of my health per kill + predatory + sustained (if I'm using my SASG). This is what keeps me up, and going nine times out of ten."
        - "<b><i>Side Note:</b></i><br>Damage wise it would be possible to use this anywhere, but legendary in my opinion. I haven't tried it yet, but they just hit too damn hard, and cheat like a motherfucker by shooting through walls, and around corners. This build requires you to constantly be on the move, out of cover for the most part. I highly recommend copying this build just for fun, to break up the monotony if you're feeling any."
