build: 
    general: 
        - "This build is a lot of fun in PvE. With Tac Link and Berserk you can hit pretty hard with an insanely high Rate of Fire."
        - "If you sit in cover you can get quite a lot more damage from the Big Alejandro's Coover Shoter talent."
        - "In case you need to shoot while out of cover and moving, Accurate will help you a lot to hit your shots."
        - "Depending on the content you run, it might make sense to replace Mobile Cover with a different Skill."
