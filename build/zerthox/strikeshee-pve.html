build: 
    general: 
        - "This is a damage oriented NinjaBike build. If possible use Classified Striker and Banshee pieces, but the build works without them aswell."
        - "Use the Showstopper to build up your stacks and the Lightweight M4 to kill NPCs. With Determined you should be able to spam your Tactical Link and mow down enemies even faster."
        - "Rolling Stability or Accuracy on the weapon mods does not really matter, feel free pick your preferred handling stat. As a PC player I prefer Accuracy because  I feel like while you can compensate recoil, compensating reticle spread is pretty much impossible."
